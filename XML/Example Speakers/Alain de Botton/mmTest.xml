His subsequent books take on some of the fundamental worries of modern life (am I happy? where exactly do I stand?), informed by his deep reading in philosophy and by a novelist&#39;s eye for small, perfect moments. His newest book is The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work. In 2008, de Botton helped start the School of Life in London, a social enterprise determined to make learning and therapy relevant in today&#39;s uptight culture. His goal is (through any of his mediums) to help clients learn &#34;how to live wisely and well.&#34;"><title>Alain de Botton: Philosopher</title><description>Through his witty and literate books -- and his new School of Life  -- Alain de Botton helps others find fulfillment in the everyday.</description><Quotes_by_this_speaker><talk_type mm_name="ted_talk" location="http://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success.html?quote=519"><title>&#8220;It&#8217;s perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living; it&#8217;s perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm, to be free of career anxiety.&#8221;</title></talk_type><talk_type mm_name="ted_talk" location="http://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success.html?quote=520"><title>&#8220;A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are.&#8221;</title></talk_type><talk_type mm_name="ted_talk" location="http://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success.html?quote=521"><title>&#8220;The problem is if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top, get to the top, you&#8217;ll also, by implication &#8230; believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there.&#8221;</title></talk_type><talk_type mm_name="ted_talk" location="http://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_atheism_2_0.html?quote=1277"><title>&#8220;It&#8217;s as though either you accept [religious] doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff, or you reject the doctrine and you&#8217;re living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of CNN and Walmart.&#8221;</title></talk_type><talk_type mm_name="ted_talk" location="http://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_atheism_2_0.html?quote=1278"><title>&#8220;The secular world is full of holes.
