No matter the scale -- kitchen, continent, or solar system -- invention grants us access to the frontiers of our understanding.&#10;&#10;Legendary designer Philippe Starck&#39;s lively ruminations on his own creative process suggest how the patterns of a civilization might affect, say, the design of a citrus juicer. Jan Chipchase investigates the worldwide impact of mobile phones -- and the impact of culture on next-generation mobile technology. Explorer and adventurer Bill Stone, meanwhile, fires up a rapt audience with his ambitious plan to harvest energy from the moon.&#10;&#10;Copyright lawyer Larry Lessig gives a brief history of creative freedom and copyright, and talks about how contemporary copyright law could strangle future artistic invention and interpretation. William Kamkwamba tells how he built a windmill from scrap metal when he was 14 years old. And Amy Smith shares her transformative low-tech tools for saving life in the developing world.</description><clippings><image_clipping simpl:id="1183826"><source_doc><theme_type simpl:ref="25697201"/></source_doc><media><image location="http://images.ted.com/images/ted/1497_291x218.jpg"><clippings_this_is_in><image_clipping simpl:ref="1183826"/></clippings_this_is_in></image></media></image_clipping></clippings></theme_type></metadata></information_composition_declaration>
